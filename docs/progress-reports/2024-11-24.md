\[5:04pm] okay, i have a few things i need to get in a "viewable"/visible state so it doesn't look like i've done nothing x.x

a current TODO summary
- [ ] smack magic layout
	- [ ] complete/finish popup wrapper system
		- [ ] on visit: chance to show a popup that's like; "1-5 left, buy now!" or somethin with a sale countdown
	- [ ] footer: TOS/policy links: open popups with nothing useful in them
		- [ ] navigation links need to be "tidied up"
- [ ] landing / about page
	- [ ] implement all layout items:
		- [ ] testimonials 1, 2, and 3
		- [ ] joe magic introduction
		- [ ] chopper "demonstration"
			- [ ] actually add JoeCoin
		- [ ] clicker game
- [ ] shop
	- [ ] improve designs using new UI styles
	- [ ] implement cart/checkout system
		- [ ] maybe add a fake form this time for more engagement?
		- [ ] (THIS FORM DATA COULD BE USED TO "SIGN UP"? (an entirely local thing for now))

\[5:09pm] ok, going to start working now. i'll ignore the fact that the landing page is ENTIRELY hidden and focus on the layout popup code first.
